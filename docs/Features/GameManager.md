GameManager is a cloud save management application focused on automatically backing up your game save data to the cloud.

GameManager is linked to your Steam account (and GeForce NOW account). Whenever Steam is running under the same account you use to play your Steam or external games, and GameManager is open, any supported game detected at startup will be automatically picked up and monitored. When you exit the game, your save data is automatically uploaded to the cloud.

# FAQ

**SALSANOW DOES NOT WORK ON FREE TIER AND ALLIANCES**

**1. Can i play games with kernel anticheat on SalsaNOW ? (Easy Anti-Cheat, Battleye etc)**

> No, because your GeForce NOW session will always be at user level, meaning you are not gonna be able to do administrator tasks.

**2. Why do i get access is denied ?**

> This is because your GeForce NOW session is only at user level, administrator tasks are not possible.

**3. My games do not save, why does this happen ?**

**THIS ONLY APPLIES FOR PERSISTENT STORAGE USERS, NOTHING SAVES WITHOUTH PERSISTENT STORAGE**

> This is because not all games save in the whitelisted folder path locations where GeForce NOW persists to, workarounds are needed to be done.<br>
> (making a batch file that creates folders, does junctions)<br>

>Folder Paths that do persist:

> **"C:\Users\kiosk\Documents"**<br>
> **"C:\Users\kiosk\AppData"**<br>
> **I:\ (The whole drive persists)**<br>

**5.  Can i use GeForce NOW for more than just games using SalsaNOW ?**

> Yes, since you have the ability of running and installing unathorized software you can run and use anything on GeForce NOW as long as it does not require administrator rights or blacklisted.<br>
> - Software that does require administrative rights at install can be installed on a local host machine and then archived, downloaded and extracted on GeForce NOW ready to use, meaning making the software portable<br>

**7. Why do i get an error message when i try extracting big in size archives with 7zip (0x8004000B)**
> This is because everything at 7zip extraction process gets stored inside the TEMP folder temporary files, which fills up the storage of the C:/ drive, the C:/ drive and the other drives except the I:/ drive only have around 60GB, in order to solve this you can access the following reddit comment link: <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/techsupport/comments/fyahjo/comment/kgoqr82/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button">Reddit Link Post</a> <br>
